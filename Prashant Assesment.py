#  ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# - This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# # To multiply two numbers

# In[4]:


X =int(input("enter the value of X"))
Y =int(input("enter the value of Y"))
Z =int(input("enter the value of Z"))
V = (X*Y)+Z
print("Additon and multiplication is " , V)


# - This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60 

# In[7]:


X =int(input("enter the value of X"))
Y =int("60")
Z = X / 60
print("Conversion of minutes into hour is " , Z)
